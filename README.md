# Customer-Churn-Analysis-in-Power-BI
This project is an end‑to‑end telecom customer churn analysis built in Power BI. It covers data cleaning, data modelling with DAX, and interactive dashboard design to help a telecom provider understand which customer segments are churning, why they are leaving, and where to focus retention efforts first.
